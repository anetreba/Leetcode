# Leetcode
Some task from leetcode

### Reverse String
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

### Sort an Array
Given an array of integers nums, sort the array in ascending order.

### Fibonacci Number
The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

### Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

### Find Common Characters
Given an array words of strings made only from lowercase letters, return a list of all characters that show up in all strings within the list (including duplicates).
For example, if a character occurs 3 times in all strings but not 4 times, you need to include that character three times in the final answer.

### Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation
Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation.
Valid operators are +, -, *, and /. Each operand may be an integer or another expression.

### Implement Queue using Stacks
Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (push, peek, pop, and empty).

### Valid Parentheses
Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
An input string is valid if:
Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
